    description: |
      Enable Multicast in the underlay on all p2p uplink interfaces and mlag l3 peer interface.
      Specifically PIM Sparse-Mode will be configured on all routed underlay interfaces.
      No other configuration is added, so the underlay will only support Source-Specific Multicast (SSM).
      The configuration is intended to be used as multicast underlay for EVPN OISM overlay.
    default: false
