# Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 4.x.x

Major releases of AVD can contain breaking changes. The porting guide addresses how to update your inventory
and playbooks to be compatible with new default behaviors and changed data models when upgrading from AVD 3.x versions.

Users of `eos_designs` do not have to consider the changes in `eos_cli_config_gen`, since those adaptions are
built into `eos_designs`.

## Common changes

### Data model changes from "dict-of-dicts" to "list-of-dicts"

In AVD 4.0.0 and across both `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen`, *all* "dict-of-dicts" data models with user-defined keys have been changed to "list-of-dicts".

As an example, `ethernet_interfaces` has been changed from:

```yaml
ethernet_intefaces:
  Ethernet1:   # <-- User defined key
    <...>
```

to:

```yaml
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet1:   # <-- "name" here is called the "primary_key" which must have a unique value across all list elements
    <...>
```

The old data models are still supported, but support will be removed in AVD 5.0.0.

In AVD 4.x inputs will be auto-converted as part of the new built-in schema-based type conversion, but the variable files will not be changed.

It is recommended to update the input data to the new data models at a convenient time after upgrading to AVD 4.x.
AVD can be configured to error on type conversions, so by running the regular playbook with `ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e avd_data_conversion_mode=error -e avd_data_validation_mode=error`
the play will be stopped, and errors will be produced for each conversion. This can be used as a list of data models to update.

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e avd_data_conversion_mode=error
<...>

<...>
```

When the list is empty the variables have been updated correctly. Notice that errors may be emitted at different stages of the play, so let it run to the end.

## Changes to role arista.avd.eos_designs

### Network services variables

- Rename `evpn_rd_type` to `overlay_rd_type`
- Rename `evpn_rt_type` to `overlay_rt_type`
- Rename `vxlan_vlan_aware_bundles` to `evpn_vlan_aware_bundles`

### Fabric variables

#### p2p_uplinks_mtu

The default value for `p2p_uplinks_mtu` has changed from 9000 to 9214.

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, set `p2p_uplinks_mtu` to 9000:

```yaml
p2p_uplinks_mtu: 9000
```

### MLAG variables

#### mlag_peer_link_allowed_vlans

`mlag_peer_link_allowed_vlans` no longer has a default value of "2-4094". The new default does not enforce specific allowed VLANs.

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, set `mlag_peer_link_allowed_vlans` to "2-4094":

```yaml
l3leaf:
  defaults:
    mlag_peer_link_allowed_vlans: "2-4094"
```

### BGP variables

#### bgp_default_ipv4_unicast

A new key, `bgp_default_ipv4_unicast: <bool> -> default false`, was introduced to implement the best practice of disabling the default activation of the IPv4 unicast address-family.

To change the default behavior, set the key to true:

```yaml
bgp_default_ipv4_unicast: true
```

!!! warning
    Configuration under the `<node_type_key>.defaults.bgp_defaults` should be removed to avoid duplicate entries in the configuration.

Example:

```yaml
l3leaf:
  defaults:
    bgp_defaults:
      # - no bgp default ipv4-unicast <--- remove this item to avoid duplicates
```

!!! note
    This will now explicitly activate or deactivate bgp_default_ipv4_unicast in the EOS configuration.

#### bgp_update_wait_install

With AVD version 4.0.0, the default configuration generated by `eos_designs` have `update wait-install` configured under `router_bgp` and BGP VRF definitions for VRFs containing BGP peers.

To change the default behavior, update the following variable to false:

```yaml
bgp_update_wait_install: false
```

#### bgp_peer_groups

The following keys under `bgp_peer_groups` have been replaced to avoid upper-case variables:

See the full data model in the [documentation](../../roles/eos_designs/docs/input-variables.md#bgp-settings)

=== "Removed keys"

    ```yaml
    bgp_peer_groups:
      IPv4_UNDERLAY_PEERS:
      MLAG_IPv4_UNDERLAY_PEER:
      EVPN_OVERLAY_PEERS:
    ```

=== "Replacement keys"

    ```yaml
    bgp_peer_groups:
      ipv4_underlay_peers:
      mlag_ipv4_underlay_peer:
      evpn_overlay_peers:
    ```

### ISIS underlay variables

#### isis_default_circuit_type

`isis_default_circuit_type` default changed from `level-1-2` (EOS default) to `level-2`.

To keep the EOS default ISIS circuit-type set:

```yaml
isis_default_circuit_type: "level-1-2"
```

!!! note
    This will now print `isis circuit-type level-1-2` in the EOS configuration matching the EOS default ISIS circuit-type.

### L3 edge variables

#### l3_edge.p2p_links.[].qos_profile

`l3_edge.p2p_links.[].qos_profile` default changed from `null` to now leverage `p2p_uplinks_qos_profile` as its default value.

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, set `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].qos_profile` to `null`:

```yaml
l3_edge:
  p2p_links:
    - qos_profile: null
```

#### l3_edge.p2p_links.[].include_in_underlay_protocol

`l3_edge.p2p_links.[].include_in_underlay_protocol` default changed from `false` to `true`.

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior set `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].include_in_underlay_protocol` to `false`:

```yaml
l3_edge:
  p2p_links:
    - include_in_underlay_protocol: false
```

#### l3_edge.p2p_links.[].isis_circuit_type

`l3_edge.p2p_links.[].isis_circuit_type` -> default changed from `level-1-2` (EOS default) set by `isis_default_circuit_type` to `level-2`.

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, set `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].isis_circuit_type` to `level-1-2`:

```yaml
l3_edge:
  p2p_links:
    - isis_circuit_type: "level-1-2"
```

!!! note
    This will now print `isis circuit-type level-1-2` in the EOS configuration matching the EOS default isis circuit-type.

#### l3_edge.p2p_links.[].isis_hello_padding

`l3_edge.p2p_links.[].isis_hello_padding` default changed from `false` to `true` (EOS default).

No changes are required to variables since this matches to EOS default configuration.

!!! note
    This will now print `isis hello padding` in the EOS configuration matching the EOS default.

#### l3_edge.p2p_links.[].ptp_enable

`l3_edge.p2p_links.[].ptp_enable` changed to `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].ptp.enabled` to create syntax consistency when configuring PTP:

=== "3.x"

    ```yaml
    l3_edge:
      p2p_links:
        ptp_enable: true
    ```

=== "4.x"

    ```yaml
    l3_edge:
      p2p_links:
        ptp:
          enabled: true
    ```

`l3_edge.p2p_links.[].ptp.enabled` requires the `ptp.enabled: true` to be set at the fabric level.

Set the following variable at the fabric level:

```yaml
ptp:
  enabled: true
```

### Core interfaces variables

#### core_interfaces.p2p_links.[].ptp_enable

`core_interfaces.p2p_links.[].ptp_enable` changed to `core_interfaces.p2p_links.[].ptp.enabled` to create syntax consistency when configuring PTP:

=== "3.x"

    ```yaml
    core_interfaces:
      p2p_links:
        ptp_enable: true
    ```

=== "4.x"

    ```yaml
    core_interfaces:
      p2p_links:
        ptp:
          enabled: true
    ```

`core_interfaces.p2p_links.[].ptp.enabled` requires the `ptp.enabled: true` to be set at the fabric level.

Set the following variable at the fabric level:

```yaml
ptp:
  enabled: true
```

### Connected endpoints

The `connected_endpoints_key.[].adapters.[].server_ports` has been removed and replaced with `connected_endpoints_key.[].adapters.[].endpoint_ports` in order to be generic across endpoint types.

=== "3.x"

    ```yaml
    <connected_endpoints_keys.key>:
      - name: <str>
        adapters:
          - server_ports:
    ```

=== "4.x"

    ```yaml
    <connected_endpoints_keys.key>:
      - name: <str>
        adapters:
          - endpoint_ports:
    ```

### IP and IPv6 routing is no longer configured on pure L2 devices

For node types like `l2leaf` where `underlay_router` is set to `false` under `node_type_keys`, AVD versions below 4.0.0
still rendered `ip routing`, `ip routing ipv6 interfaces`, or `ipv6 unicast-routing` in the configuration.
As of AVD version 4.0.0, these IP and IPv6 routing configurations are no longer configured for `l2leaf`
or other node types with `underlay_router: false`.

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, the inventory can be updated like this:

```yaml
l2leaf:
  defaults:
    always_configure_ip_routing: true
```

### BGP is no longer configured on irrelevant nodes

An example of an "irrelevant node" is a pure L3 Spine in L3LS running ISIS or OSPF in the underlay. As long as the spine is not
set as route-server for any overlay BGP protocol, there is no need for `router bgp <asn>` to be configured on this device.

Example of default configuration previously generated but now removed:

```eos
router bgp 65000
  router-id 192.168.255.2
  maximum-paths 4 ecmp 4
```

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, the inventory can be updated like this:

```yaml
spine:
  defaults:
    structured_config:
      router_bgp:
        as: '65000'
        router_id: 192.168.255.2
        maximum_paths:
          paths: 4
          ecmp: 4
```

### Link-local IPv6 addressing is implicitly enabled when configuring IPv6 Anycast IP

Per Arista best practice, all SVIs configured with `ipv6 address virtual` should also have
`ipv6 enable` configured, to use link-local IPv6 addresses for NDv6 operations.

With AVD version 4.0.0, this best practice is now implemented by default.

Example input:

```yaml
tenants:
  - name: mytenant
    <...>
    vrfs:
      - name: myvrf
        <...>
        svis:
          - id: 123
            <...>
            ipv6_address_virtuals:
              - 2001:db8:12::1/64
```

Now renders:

```eos
interface Vlan123
  <...>
  ipv6 enable                  ! <-- New command
  ipv6 address virtual 2001:db8:12::1/64
```

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, the inventory can be updated like this:

```yaml
tenants:
  - name: mytenant
    <...>
    vrfs:
      - name: myvrf
        <...>
        svis:
          - id: 123
            <...>
            ipv6_address_virtuals:
              - 2001:db8:12::1/64
            ipv6_enable: false # <--- Overriding the new default behavior
```

### In-band management for L2 switches

With AVD version 4.0.0, some of the default values for in-band management are changing:

- The SVI MTU was derived from `p2p_uplinks_mtu` with a default value of `9000`. Now the SVI MTU defaults to `1500` and is configurable with `inband_mgmt_mtu`.
- The SVI description was hardcoded to `L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT`. The default SVI description is `Inband Management` and is configurable with `inband_mgmt_description`.
- The VLAN name was hardcoded to `L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT`. The default VLAN name is `INBAND_MGMT` and is configurable with `inband_mgmt_vlan_name`.

See the following example of modifying the values to retain the previous default behavior.

Previous default configuration:

```eos
vlan 4092
  name L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT

interface Vlan4092
  description L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT
  mtu 9000
  <...>
```

New default configuration:

```eos
vlan 4092
  name INBAND_MGMT

interface Vlan4092
  description Inband Management
  mtu 1500
  <...>
```

To retain the AVD 3.x behavior, the inventory can be updated like this:

```yaml
l2leaf:
  defaults:
    inband_mgmt_mtu: 9000
    inband_mgmt_vlan_name: L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT
    inband_mgmt_description: L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT

l3leaf:
  defaults:
    inband_mgmt_mtu: 9000
    inband_mgmt_vlan_name: L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT
    inband_mgmt_description: L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT
```

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen`

### Non port-channel related config is no longer ignored on port-channel member ethernet_interfaces

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining new interfaces
with `structured_config`, `custom_structured_configuration_`, or when using `eos_cli_config_gen` directly.

With AVD 4.0.0, port-channel member interfaces defined under `ethernet_interfaces` will no longer ignore the
`type` setting, which defaults to `switched`. Other switchport or IP related features are also no longer ignored.

This may be the intended behavior for interfaces with LACP fallback, which is the reason for this change.

Example input:

```yaml
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet2
    channel_group:
      id: 2
      mode: active
    mode: access    # <--- These are just examples of "other configurations"
    vlans: 123      # <--- that were previously ignored.
```

Previous output:

```eos
interface Ethernet2
   channel-group 2 mode active
```

AVD version 4.x output:

```eos
interface Ethernet2
   switchport
   switchport mode access
   switchport access vlan 123
   channel-group 2 mode active
```

To retain the AVD 3.x configuration, the interface definition must be updated like this:

```yaml
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet2
    type: port-channel-member
    channel_group:
      id: 2
      mode: active
```

### hardware_counters.features

The `hardware_counters.features` model has been improved to allow more options.

=== "3.x"

    ```yaml
    hardware_counters:
      features:
        - ip: in
        - ip: out
        - vlan-interfaces: in
    ```

=== "4.x"

    ```yaml
    hardware_counters:
      features:
        - name: ip
          direction: out
        - name: ip
          direction: in
        - name: vlan-interfaces
          direction: in
    ```

See the full data model in the [documentation](../../roles/eos_cli_config_gen/docs/input-variables.md#hardware-counters)

### ip_name_servers

The `name_server` key has been deprecated in favor of `ip_name_servers`, more
aligned with the EOS CLI.

See the full data model in the [documentation](../../roles/eos_cli_config_gen/docs/input-variables.md#ip-name-servers)

=== "3.x"

    ```yaml
    name_server:
      source:
        vrf: MGMT
      nodes:
        - 8.8.8.8
    ```

=== "4.x"

    ```yaml
    ip_name_servers:
      - ip_address: 8.8.8.8
        vrf: MGMT
    ```

### ip_igmp_snooping

Disabling IGMP Snooping globally no longer blocks other IGMP snooping configuration.

Example input:

```yaml
ip_igmp_snooping:
  globally_enabled: false
  vlans:
    - id: 10
      enabled: true
    - id: 20
      enabled: false
    - id: 30
      enabled: false
```

Previous output:

```eos
no ip igmp snooping
```

AVD version 4.x output:

```eos
no ip igmp snooping
ip igmp snooping vlan 10
no ip igmp snooping vlan 20
no ip igmp snooping vlan 30
```

While EOS accepts the extra configuration, IGMP snooping is still effectively disabled.
To remove the extra configuration, update the inputs like this:

```yaml
ip_igmp_snooping:
  globally_enabled: false
```

### queue_monitor_length

To avoid ambiguous YAML data input, the data model for `queue_monitor_length` has been updated to require the `enabled` key.

=== "3.x"

    ```yaml
    queue_monitor_length:
      <...>
    ```

=== "4.x"

    ```yaml
    queue_monitor_length:
      enabled: true
      <...>
    ```

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

### vlan_interfaces.[].ip_attached_host_route_export

To avoid ambiguous YAML data input, the data model for `vlan_interfaces.[].ip_attached_host_route_export` has been updated to require the `enabled`.

=== "3.x"

    ```yaml
    vlan_interfaces:
      Vlan86:
        ip_address: 10.10.83.1/24
        ip_attached_host_route_export: {}
    ```

=== "4.x (new list form input)"

    ```yaml
    vlan_interfaces:
      - name: Vlan86
        ip_address: 10.10.83.1/24
        ip_attached_host_route_export:
          enabled: true
    ```

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs` so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

### New data model for BGP VRF address-families

An improved data model for address family configuration under `router_bgp.vrfs` has been added, containing discrete models for the different address-families including subkeys for `bgp additional-paths` configuration options.

=== "3.x (wildcard dictionaries)"

    ```yaml
    router_bgp:
      vrfs:
        - name: VRF001
          address_families:
            ipv4:
              bgp:
                additional_paths:
                  - send any
              neighbors:
                10.2.3.4:
                  activate: true
                  route_map_out: RM-10.2.3.4-SET-NEXT-HOP-OUT
              networks:
                "100.64.0.0/10":
                  route_map: RM-10.2.3.4
              peer_groups:
                TEST_PEER_GRP:
                  activate: true
                  next_hop:
                    address_family_ipv6_originate: true
            ipv6:
              ...
    ```

=== "4.x (discrete dictionary keys for all supported address families)"

    ```yaml
    router_bgp:
      peer_groups:
        - name: TEST_PEER_GRP
          activate: true
          next_hop:
            address_family_ipv6:
              enabled: true
              originate: true
      vrfs:
        - name: VRF001
          address_family_ipv4:
            bgp:
              additional_paths:
                send:
                  any: true
            neighbors:
              - ip_address: 10.2.3.4
                activate: true
                route_map_out: RM-10.2.3.4-SET-NEXT-HOP-OUT
            networks:
              - prefix: 100.64.0.0/10
                route_map: RM-10.2.3.4
          address_family_ipv6:
            ...
    ```

!!! note
    The change has been incorporated into eos_designs, no action is necessary to retain the same functionality. If using `structured_config` or `custom_structured_configuration_` to enable this feature, it is recommended to migrate to using the new data model.

### Replacement data model for `next_hop.address_family_ipv6_originate` under `router_bgp.address_family_ipv4.peer_groups`

The data model to turn on ipv4 routing over ipv6 next-hops has been replaced with a new extended one, the old data model has been deprecated and will be removed in AVD version 5.0.0.

An example of the old data model:

```yaml
router_bgp:
  address_family_ipv4:
    peer_groups:
      - name: EXAMPLE
        next_hop:
          address_family_ipv6_originate: < bool >
```

An example of the new data model:

```yaml

!!! note
    The change has been incorporated into eos_designs, no action is necessary to retain the same functionality. If using `structured_config` or `custom_structured_configuration_` to enable this feature, it is recommended to migrate to using the new data model.

### Sanitized configuration

Starting in AVD 4.0.0, the `eos_cli_config_gen` role replaces sensitive values in the device documentation by the string `<removed>` by default, similar to the output of `show run sanitized` on EOS.

To retain the 3.x behavior, the inventory can be updated like this:

```yaml
eos_cli_config_gen_documentation:
  hide_passwords: false # default true
```

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp`

### Inventory to CloudVision containers

In AVD 4.0.0, the role `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` gets support for dynamic Ansible inventories. This means the CloudVision containers' basis will no longer be the `inventory.yml` file. Instead, the role reads the loaded Ansible inventory. This inventory can be loaded from dynamic inventory plugins like Ansible Automation Platform, AWX, etc.

The new inventory parsing is stricter than the previous method, so all Ansible inventory groups *must* be laid
out as a regular tree structure starting from the `container_root`.

The 3.x behavior can be retained by adding the variable `avd_inventory_to_container_file: "{{ inventory_file }}"` to the playbook task
for `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` like this example:

```yaml
- name: Configuration deployment with CVP
  hosts: cv_servers
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  collections:
    - arista.avd
  tasks:
    - name: Provision CVP
      import_role:
        name: eos_config_deploy_cvp
      vars:
        container_root: 'DC1_FABRIC'
        configlets_prefix: 'AVD'
        state: present
        avd_inventory_to_container_file: "{{ inventory_file }}"  # <--- Retain old behavior from AVD v3.x.x
```

#### Supported group structure

In this example, the `container_root` is set to `DC1_FABRIC`. This means the container root and all groups below will be created as containers on CloudVision. Devices can be members of multiple group hierarchies like `DC1_FABRIC` and `DC1_TENANT_NETWORKS` as long as the other hierarchies are not below the group set as `container_root`.

```yaml
---
all:
  children:
    DC1:
      children:
        DC1_FABRIC:
          children:
            DC1_SPINES:
              hosts:
                DC1-SPINE1:

            DC1_L3LEAFS:
              children:

                    DC1-LEAF1A:
                    DC1-LEAF1B:
                DC1_LEAF2:
                  hosts:
                    DC1-LEAF2A:
                    DC1-LEAF2B:
        DC1_TENANTS_NETWORKS:  # <--- This group is under DC1, but it is NOT under DC1_FABRIC, so this inventory is supported
          children:
            DC1_L3LEAFS:
```

#### Unsupported group structure

        DC1_FABRIC:
          children:

                  hosts:
                    DC1-LEAF2A:
                    DC1-LEAF2B:
            DC1_TENANTS_NETWORKS:  # <--- This group is under DC1_FABRIC, making DC1_L3LEAFS have two "parents",
              children:            #      so this inventory is *not* supported with the new inventory parser
                DC1_L3LEAFS:
```

## Roles `cvp_configlet_upload` and `eos_config_deploy_cvp` default to `cv_collection: v3`

The roles `arista.avd.cvp_configlet_upload` and `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` leverage modules from the `arista.cvp` collection to perform actions on the CloudVision Platform. These modules are currently available in `v1` and `v3` variants, but `v1` modules have been deprecated. They will be removed from the `arista.cvp` collection in version 4.0.0.

With AVD version 4.0.0, the default `cv_collection` is set to `v3`.

The `v3` modules are mostly compatible with the `v1` modules, with a few known gaps:

- `v3` lacks support for hostnames with dots like `leaf1.dc2`.
- The implementation of `v3` in `eos_config_deploy_cvp` is missing support for the `absent` option.

`v1` modules can still be used by setting `cv_collection: v1`, as long as the `arista.cvp` collection is not upgraded to 4.0.0 or above.
