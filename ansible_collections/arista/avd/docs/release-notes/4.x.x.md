- As per https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#ansible-core-support-matrix, `ansible-core` version 2.12 was declared End-of-Life (EOL) on May 22nd 2023 and version 2.13 will be declared EOL on November 6th 2023.

  AVD will drop support for `ansible-core` versions 2.12 and 2.13 in the next **minor** release after November 6th 2023.

- Since `ansible-core` versions above 2.14 do not support Python versions below 3.9, the support for Python 3.8 will be dropped from AVD at the same time.

- The `arista.avd.verify_requirements` module will start emitting deprecation warnings starting AVD 4.4 to warn users about these deprecations.

### Fixed issues in eos_designs

- Fix(eos_designs) - Configuration of PTP for port-channel uplinks by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/3112

  L2leaf switches were included in the original implementation of PTP for a fabric, but configuration for the port-channel uplinks were missed. This fix adds the missing configuration for the uplinks of l2 leaf switches.

  !!! note
      Although this missing configuration was a bug, some deployments may not want it. If so, they can set

      ```yaml
      l2leaf:
        nodes:
          - name: <hostname>
            ...
            uplink_ptp:
              enable: false
      ```

## Release 4.0.0

### Changes to requirements

- AVD now requires ansible-core from **2.12.6** to **2.14.x** excluding **2.13.0**
!!! note
    Excluded version **2.13.0** has an issue in `ansible-core`, which is [fixed](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.13.1/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.13.rst#bugfixes) in **2.13.1**. Plugin loader will now load config data for plugin by name instead of by file to avoid issues with the same file being loaded under different names (Fully-Qualified-Collection-Name + short-name).

  If Ansible is installed using pip, a supported version can be installed with `pip3 install "ansible-core>=2.12.6,<2.15.0,!=2.13.0"`.

- The `arista.avd` collection no longer depends directly on `ansible.netcommon`. `ansible.netcommon` is still a depedency of `arista.eos` and `arista.cvp`, which are both dependencies of `arista.avd`.

- AVD now requires the minumum versions of the following Ansible collections:
  - arista.cvp version 3.6.1 or later.
  - arista.eos version 6.0.1 or later.
  - ansible.utils version 2.10.3 or later.

- AVD now requires `cvprac` python library to be version 1.3.1 or higher.

### Data model changes from "dict-of-dicts" to "list-of-dicts"

In AVD 4.0.0 and across both `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen`, *all* "dict-of-dicts" data models with user-defined keys have been changed to "list-of-dicts".

As an example `ethernet_interfaces` has been changed from:

```yaml
ethernet_intefaces:
  Ethernet1:   # <-- User defined key
    <...>
```

to:

```yaml
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet1:   # <-- "name" here is called the "primary_key" which must have a unique value across all list elements
    <...>
```

The old data models are still supported, but support will be removed in AVD 5.0.0.

In AVD 4.0.0, inputs will be auto-converted as part of the new built-in schema-based type conversion, but the variable files will not be changed.

See details on how to migrate to the new data models in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#data-model-changes-from-dict-of-dicts-to-list-of-dicts).

### All eos_designs and eos_cli_config_gen variables are validated by schemas

In AVD 4.0.0, all eos_designs and eos_cli_config_gen keys are validated by schemas.
If additional custom keys are desired, a key starting with an underscore `_`, will be ignored.

### Breaking or behavioral changes in eos_cli_config_gen

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md)
for details.

#### Non port-channel related config is no longer ignored on port-channel member ethernet_interfaces

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs` so action is only required when defining new interfaces
with `structured_config`, `custom_structured_configuration_` or when using `eos_cli_config_gen` directly.

With AVD 4.0.0 port-channel member interfaces defined under `ethernet_interfaces` will no longer ignore the
`type` setting which defaults to `switched`. Other switchport or IP related features are also no longer ignored.

For interfaces with LACP fallback, this may be the intended behavior, and this is the reason for this change.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#non-port-channel-related-config-is-no-longer-ignored-on-port-channel-member-ethernet_interfaces).

Pull request:

- Feat(eos_designs, eos_cli_config_gen)! - Remove default "switchport" and remove logic from eos_cli_config_gen by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2430

#### Require queue_monitor_length.enabled

To avoid ambiguous YAML data input, the data model for `queue_monitor_length` has been updated to require the `enabled` key to be set.

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs` so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#require-enabled-key-under-queue_monitor_length).

Pull request:

- Refactor(eos_cli_config_gen)! - Require queue_monitor_length.enabled to be set by @Shivani-chourasiya in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2429

#### Disabling IGMP Snooping globally no longer blocks other IGMP snooping configuration

The `eos_cli_config_gen` role previously blocked IGMP snooping configuration if `ip_igmp_snooping.globally_enabled` was set to `false`.
With AVD version 4.0.0 this changes to align closer to EOS behavior, where globally disabling IGMP snooping still allows for underlying
configuration to be present.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#new-behavior-for-ip_igmp_snooping).

Pull request:

- Feat(eos_designs)! - Remove default value from mlag_peer_link_allowed_vlans by @carlbuchmann in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2845

#### New required vlan_interfaces.[].ip_attached_host_route_export.enabled key

To avoid ambiguous YAML data input, the data model for `vlan_interfaces.[].ip_attached_host_route_export` has been updated to require
an `enabled: true` key to be added.

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs` so action is only required when defining `structured_configuration` directly.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#new-required-enabled-key-under-vlan_interfacesip_attached_host_route_export).

Pull request:

- Refactor(eos_cli_config_gen)! - Require `enabled - true` under `vlan_interfaces.[].ip_attached_host_route_export` by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2773

#### New data model for BGP VRF address-families

New data models to replace the now deprecated `router_bgp.vrfs[].address_families` keys have been added to eos_cli_config_gen.

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs` so no action is necessary to retain the same functionality.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#new-data-model-for-bgp-vrf-address-families)

#### Replacement data model for `next_hop.address_family_ipv6_originate` under `router_bgp.address_family_ipv4.peer_groups[]`

The data model to turn on ipv4 routing over ipv6 next-hops has been replaced with a new extended one, the old data model has been deprecated and will be removed in AVD version 5.0.0.

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs` so no action is necessary to retain the same functionality.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#replacement-data-model-for-next_hopaddress_family_ipv6_originate-under-router_bgpaddress_family_ipv4peer_groups)

#### Improved hardware_counters.features data model

The `hardware_counters.features` model has been improved to allow more options.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#hardware_counters.features).

Pull requests:

- Feat(eos_cli_config_gen)! - Change Hardware Counter model by @gmuloc in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2695

#### `eos_cli_config_gen` sanitized device documentation

- Starting AVD 4.0.0, the `eos_cli_config_gen` role replaces sensitive values in the device documentation by the string `<removed>` by default, similar to the output of `show run sanitized` on EOS.
- It is also possible to generate the intended configurations by replacing the sensitive data by `<removed>` but this is not the case by default
- This behavior can be controlled using the following variables:

    ```yaml
    eos_cli_config_gen_documentation:
      hide_passwords: <bool> # default true
    eos_cli_config_gen_configuration:
      hide_passwords: <bool> # default false
    ```

**NOTE:** The `structured_config` generated by `eos_designs` role cannot be sanitized.

### Breaking or behavioral changes in eos_designs

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md)
for details.

#### Custom structured configuration behavioral change

Related to the data model changes mentioned [above](#data-model-changes-from-dict-of-dicts-to-list-of-dicts), the behavior of
`custom_structured_configuration_*` and `structured_config` keys has also changed:

1. The default list merge strategy set with `custom_structured_configuration_list_merge` is now `append_rp` meaning "Append unique items".
   Changed from `replace`.
2. Unless list merge is set to `replace`, the merge of custom structured configuration will now merge list-of-dicts based on the "primary_key" set
   in the schema of the data model, falling back to the list merge strategy.

The custom structured configuration feature is not able to remove individual items from a list. This is not a new limitation, but since
more data models are now lists, this limitation may affect the ability to remove certain elements from the generated configurations.

#### MLAG peer link allowed vlans no longer has a default value

`mlag_peer_link_allowed_vlans` no longer has a default value of "2-4094".

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#mlag-peer-link-allowed-vlans).

#### IP routing is no longer configured on pure L2 devices

For node types like `l2leaf` where `underlay_router` is set to `false` under `node_type_keys` AVD versions below 4.0.0
still rendered `ip routing` in the configuration. With AVD version 4.0.0 `ip routing` is no longer configured for `l2leaf`
or other node types with `underlay_router: false`.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#ip-and-ipv6-routing-is-no-longer-configured-on-pure-l2-devices).

Pull request:

- Fix(eos_designs)! - Prevent configuration of IP routing on l2leaf by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2684

#### BGP is no longer configured on irrelevant nodes

An example of an "irrelevant node" is a pure L3 Spine in L3LS running ISIS or OSPF in the underlay. As long as the spine is not
set as route-server for any overlay BGP protocol, there is no need for `router bgp <asn>` to be configured on this device.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#bgp-is-no-longer-configured-on-irrelevant-nodes).

Pull request:

- Fix(eos_designs)! - Remove BGP rendering on irrelevant nodes by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2774

#### Link-local IPv6 addressing is implicitly enabled when configuring IPv6 Anycast IP

Per Arista best practice, all SVIs configured with `ipv6 address virtual` should also have
`ipv6 enable` configured, to use link-local IPv6 addresses for NDv6 operations.

With AVD version 4.0.0 this best practice is now implemented by default.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#link-local-ipv6-addressing-is-implicitly-enabled-when-configuring-ipv6-anycast-ip).

#### Removed eos_designs variables

- `evpn_rd_type` has been removed and replaced with `overlay_rd_type`.
- `evpn_rt_type` has been removed and replaced with `overlay_rt_type`.
- `vxlan_vlan_aware_bundles` has been removed and replaced with `evpn_vlan_aware_bundles`

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#network-services-variables).

- `bgp_peer_groups.IPv4_UNDERLAY_PEERS` has been removed and replaced with `bgp_peer_groups.ipv4_underlay_peers` to avoid upper-case variables.
- `bgp_peer_groups.MLAG_IPv4_UNDERLAY_PEER` has been removed and replaced with `bgp_peer_groups.mlag_ipv4_underlay_peer` to avoid upper-case variables.
- `bgp_peer_groups.EVPN_OVERLAY_PEERS` has been removed and replaced with `bgp_peer_groups.evpn_overlay_peers` to avoid upper-case variables.
- `connected_endpoints_key.[].adapters.[].server_ports` has been removed and replaced with `connected_endpoints_key.[].adapters.[].endpoint_ports`.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#bgp-variables).

#### Change in defaults in underlay ISIS variables

- `isis_default_circuit_type`  default changed from `level-1-2` (EOS default) to `level-2`.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#isis-underlay-variables).

#### Change in defaults in BGP variables

- `bgp_default_ipv4_unicast: <bool> -> default false` was introduced to implement the best practice of disabling the default activation of IPv4 unicast address-family.
- `bgp_update_wait_install: <bool> -> default true` was introduced to implement the best practice of enable router bgp `update wait-install` under `router bgp` and BGP VRF definitions for VRFs containing BGP peerings.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#bgp-variables).

#### Change in default MTU for point-to-point ethernet interfaces

The default value for `p2p_uplinks_mtu` has changed from 9000 to 9214.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#p2p-uplink-mtu).

Pull request:

- Feat(eos_designs)! - Change p2p_uplinks_mtu default value from 9000 to 9214 by @carlbuchmann in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2844

#### Change in behavior in core_interfaces variables

- `core_interfaces.p2p_links.[].ptp_enable` changed to `core_interfaces.p2p_links.[].ptp.enabled` to create syntax consistency when configuring PTP.
- `core_interfaces.p2p_links.[].ptp.enabled` requires the `ptp.enabled: true` to be set at the fabric level.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#core-interfaces-variables).

#### Change in defaults and behavior in l3_edge variables

- `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].qos_profile` default changed from `null` to now leverage `p2p_uplinks_qos_profile` as its default value.
- `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].include_in_underlay_protocol` default changed from `false` to `true`.
- `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].isis_circuit_type` -> default changed from `level-1-2` (EOS default) set by `isis_default_circuit_type` to `level-2`.
- `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].isis_hello_padding` default changed from `false` to `true` (EOS default).
- `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].ptp_enable` changed to `l3_edge.p2p_links.[].ptp.enabled` to create syntax consistency when configuring PTP.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#l3-edge-variables).

#### Changes to inband management for L2 switches

With AVD version 4.0.0 some of the default values for inband management are changing:

- The SVI MTU was derived from `p2p_uplinks_mtu` with a default value of `9000`. Now the SVI MTU defaults to `1500` and is configurable with `inband_mgmt_mtu`.
- The SVI description was hardcoded to `L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT`. Now the default SVI description is `Inband Management` and is configurable with `inband_mgmt_description`.
- The VLAN name was hardcoded to `L2LEAF_INBAND_MGMT`. Now the default VLAN name is `INBAND_MGMT` and is configurable with `inband_mgmt_vlan_name`.

The inband management interfaces are now documented and configured as `vlan_interfaces` instead of `management_interfaces`.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#changes-to-inband-management-for-l2-switches).

Pull request:

- Feat(eos_designs)! - Enhance inband management configuration options by @pvinci-arista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2712

#### Several internal switch.* facts and avd_switch_facts have been removed

As part of optimizing performance and code reuse, the amount of `switch.*` facts has been limited.

The `switch.*` and `avd_switch_facts` are internal datamodels used for sharing data between various stages of `eos_designs`. They **should not**
be used in custom templates for interface descriptions or IP addressing, since they are subject to change without notice.

See the porting guide for suggestions on how to leverage AVD logic in combination with Ansible inline Jinja2.

The following facts have been removed from `switch.*` and `avd_switch_facts.<hostname>.switch.*`:

```yaml
switch.always_configure_ip_routing
switch.always_include_vrfs_in_tenants
switch.bgp
switch.bgp_cluster_id

### Other breaking or behavioral changes

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md)
for details.

#### Roles `cvp_configlet_upload` and `eos_config_deploy_cvp` default to `cv_collection: v3`

The roles `arista.avd.cvp_configlet_upload` and `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` leverage modules from the `arista.cvp`
collection to perform actions on the CloudVision platform. These modules are currently available in `v1` and `v3` variants, but `v1` modules
have been deprecated and will be removed from the `arista.cvp` collection in version 4.0.0.

With AVD version 4.0.0 the default `cv_collection` is set to `v3`.

The `v3` modules are mostly compatible with the `v1` modules with a few known gaps:

- `v3` is missing support for hostnames with dots like `leaf1.dc2`.
- The implementation of `v3` in `eos_config_deploy_cvp` is missing support for the `absent` option.

`v1` modules can still be used by setting `cv_collection: v1`, as long as the `arista.cvp` collection is not upgraded to 4.0.0 or above.

Pull request:

- Bump(cvp_configlet_upload,eos_config_deploy_cvp)! - Update the default `cv_collection` from `v1` to `v3` by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2882

#### Change upper case CVP roles and module vars to lower case

Potentially breaking in rare cases where custom logic relies on the registered vars or content of files.
The custom scripts must be updated to use the lowercase variable instead.

Component(s) name
Roles:

- arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp
- arista.avd.cvp_configlet_upload

Modules:

- arista.avd.inventory_to_container
- arista.avd.configlet_build_config

The following vars are changed from uppercase to lowercase, to conform with Ansible linting requirements.

```sh
CVP_CONFIGLETS -> cvp_configlets
CVP_CONFIGLETS_STATUS -> cvp_configlets_status
CVP_CONTAINERS -> cvp_containers
CVP_CONTAINER_RESULTS -> cvp_container_results
CVP_DEVICES -> cvp_devices
CVP_DEVICES_RESULTS -> cvp_devices_results
CVP_FACTS -> cvp_facts
CVP_TOPOLOGY -> cvp_topology
CVP_VARS -> cvp_vars
```

Pull request:

- Fix! - Change uppercase CVP role vars to lower case by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/pull/2504

#### Changes to inventory to CloudVision containers

In AVD 4.0.0, the role `arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp` gets support for dynamic Ansible inventories. This means the CloudVision containers' basis will no longer be the `inventory.yml` file. Instead, the role reads the loaded Ansible inventory. This inventory can be loaded from dynamic inventory plugins like Ansible Automation Platform, AWX, etc.

The new inventory parsing is stricter than the previous method, so all Ansible inventory groups *must* be laid
out as a regular tree structure starting from the `container_root`.

See details in the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md#inventory-to-cloudvision-containers).
